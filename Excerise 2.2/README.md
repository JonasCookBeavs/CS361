1. DRY stands for Don't Repeat Yourself and basically means that you should write code where each part of it serves only one purpose. This mostly pertains to functions but can also pertain to many other aspects of code.

2. Functions should not only have one statement, though they can (i.e my borgified_name function). Serving one purpose just means that one function should carry the job of doing multiple things. This comes in to play if a function ever has a boolean as a parameter, indicating that it would do two seperate things depending on if that boolean was true or false.

3. Having a function seperate from everything else, even if its only used in one place, can have merit for a few reasons. One is that if the code is still being updated, that function may be used more in the future, or find its place being used inside a different function. In that case having it seperate it obviously beneficial. Additionally, sometimes with large computations its nice to have things seperated out into different functions that have names describing what parts the play, instead of using code comments to denote everything. The main benefit is simply cleaner looking code, not necessarily for ease of reading like a book.
